Sentiment Analysis with Bag of Words Method

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using the Bag of Words (BoW) method for classification. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text. The Bag of Words approach represents text data as numerical feature vectors, disregarding grammar and word order, and is commonly used in natural language processing tasks.

Project Overview

In this project, we aim to analyze the sentiment of text data using the Bag of Words method. The process involves several steps including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. We utilize a variety of Python libraries to perform these tasks efficiently.Here We have determined the sentiment involve in the tweets whether it is   positive or negative.
